<p>
  So, I&#39;ve recently received my github copilot preview access and I wanted
  to use it ASAP, unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have the opportunity to test it up
  until now, for which I feel very exited about, so I wanted to write a hands-on
  post on the topic.
</p>
<h1 id="have-you-got-the-preview-access-">Have you got the preview access?</h1>
<p>
  Once copilot is out, it will be available for everybody for a cheap price
  <del
    >selling your soul to the microsoft which I&#39;d say is a reasonable price
    for the experience</del
  >, or maybe for free <del>if nobody pays for it</del>, but we&#39;ll have to
  wait up until then. fortunately I&#39;ve already got my preview access
  approved, which can be confirmed by looking at the next screenshot, so I
  decided to make a guide on how to set everything up and add it to my tools
  repertory at once.

<p>
  The installation process is quite straight forward, and it&#39;s available for
  the most popular IDEs <strong>aka VSCODE, JetBrains and Neovim</strong>
  <del>this has to be a joke, where is atom???</del> which have demonstrated
  their value to the community in every occasion. Because I&#39;m
  <del>not a soulless being</del> used to <strong>VSCODE</strong>, I&#39;ll just
  set a new workspace in there. So first step is getting to the extensions page
  within VSCODE and look up for &quot;Github Copilot Extension&quot;.
</p>
<p><image src="copilot-extension.png" alt="copilot extension" /></p>
<h3 id="signing-in">Signing in</h3>
<p>
  The extension will show a pop up in the bottom right side of your VSCODE
  window, where you&#39;ll have to sign in with github, just click accept to
  everything that could come up after that and you&#39;ll be okay.
</p>

</p>
<h3 id="first-usage">First usage</h3>
<p>
  The only thing left for you to do is to create a testing file. I&#39;ll go by
  creating a <code>test.js</code> file and then start typing a function
  prototype, if everything works, a drop down suggestions attachment is going to
  show, there you&#39;ll have to press <code>tab</code> to accept the
  suggestion.
</p>
<p>

  <image src="accept-suggestion.png" alt="accept suggestion" />
</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>
  If the first suggestion doesn&#39;t fit your needs, you can press
  <code>Alt + ]</code> or <code>Alt + [</code> to navigate trough some more
  options or you can press <code>Ctrl + Enter</code> to open up a new panel
  where you can inspect all suggestions at once. You can Also add comments
  before your function declaration and copilot will take that into consideration
  in order to provide more accurate results
</p>

<p>
  Even tho copilot could be a great tool, it could not help anybody if the
  supported languages are limited to the top 3 most used languages
  <del>aka JS, Python and Matlab, amerite?</del>. So I tried to get a curated
  list of the supported file extensions for this preview stage and I could not
  find anything <del>Even tho I googled it once, seriously?</del> so I&#39;ll
  dig deeper in a future article, but for the sake of demonstration, I created a
  bash file and OMG it actually worked.
</p>
<p><image src="bash-file.png" alt="bash file" /></p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>
  So copilot is actually working, but I&#39;ll have to test it extensively
  before throwing up my opinion about its usability and possibilities. but I
  want to add that some people are quite worried because of this type of tool
  and the possibility of <del>everybody getting fired</del> reducing the amount
  of hours a programmer can actually work, but the thing is that the programmers
  daytime is not actually 100% programming, it is in fact mostly reading,
  debugging, setting up tools, coming up with ideas, communicate them; so for
  the time being I wouldn&#39;t be worried because of this, specially because
  there are a hell lot more of important problems out there to worry about, such
  as: global warming, war, hunger and the sharknado&#39;s saga. bye!
